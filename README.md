zig build --release=safe
```

export YOUR_ENV=SOME_VALUE

exec my-binary
```

## Configuration & Environment Variables

you can build from source with '-Dtracing-child=true' or set **ZINIT_TRACING_CHILD=ON** at runtime to make child process waiting before execvpe.

The priority of **ZINIT_TRACING_CHILD** is higher than build config, you can set this to **ON** or **OFF** to override config value.

One usage is using strace to tracing child process.
